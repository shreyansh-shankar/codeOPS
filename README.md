## 🚀 Overview

**taskOPS** is a fast, minimalist, and distraction-free command-line task manager. Designed to stay out of your way and boost productivity, `taskOPS` works right inside your terminal—no more jumping between windows to manage tasks.

> 📁 All tasks are saved in a JSON file in your home directory (`~/taskOPS/tasks.json`), making your task data portable and OS-independent.

## 📦 Installation

### 🧊 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/taskOPS.git
cd taskOPS
```

🧪 How it Works

    On first run:

        Checks for a ~/taskOPS/tasks.json file.

        If not found, it creates the folder and copies a template file from the app.

    From then on:

        All tasks are stored/loaded from ~/taskOPS/tasks.json.

    This ensures proper write access and cross-platform support.
